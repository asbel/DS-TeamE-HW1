# COMP 339 : Distributed Systems - [Project 1/Homework 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FOOk35mq5XxJkJTWfHTGp_U7AZa-UsW_ZVuDDruv934/edit?usp=sharing)
#### Team E: Asbel A, Jack B, Faisal S

### Objective: develop/design an OO API that allows you to do the following:
- Create a smart device instance
- Add/remove/update delete the smart device in a group of devices
- Move devices between groups
- Turn on/off a device
- Show the state of all devices
- Set a timer for a device with a simple trigger (on/off), i.e. turn off device 30 minutes after it was turned on.
- Set a schedule for a device (on/off), i.e. turn on a device at 12:30.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:

1. use the command 'gradlew build' or 'gradle build' to build the project, this also runs the tests and sees if they pass
2. navigate to build then libs folder in SEcode to find the jar file, and run it using java -jar <nameofjar>.jar, it should be something like java -jar snapshot.jar
3. follow terminal prompts
